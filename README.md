# Config v.0.3.0

**Config** is a basic checklist I follow to set up a new Mac's development environment. It gets me up to speed with Git, Ruby, GitHub, Jekyll, and more so I can more quickly get back to coding.

## Contents

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `.bash_profile` | Customizes the Terminal.app prompt and echoes the currently checked out Git branch. |
| `.gitconfig` | Global Git configuration to specify my name and email, shortcuts, colors, and more. |
| `.gitignore` | The ignore file from [twbs/bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) that I use everywhere. |ïœ€

## Checklist

### 1. Prep OS X

- Download and install latest version of Xcode from the Mac App Store.
- Download and install Xcode Command Line Tools from <https://developer.apple.com/downloads/>.

**Be sure to open Xcode and agree to the terms of use.**

### 2. Prep Terminal.app

- Load [`.bash_profile`](/.bash_profile)
- Load [`.gitconfig`](/.gitconfig) contents into the global `~/.gitconfig`
- Load up the Ocean theme from <https://github.com/mdo/ocean-terminal>

### 3. Secure Git(Hub) access

- [Generate new SSH key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/)
- [Generate an access token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/) for Terminal to auth your GitHub account when 2FA is enabled.

### 4. GitHub dev setup

- Download the Strap setup script for GitHub's foundational development setup.
- Clone the `github/github` repository and run `script/osx-setup`.

### 5. Setup Ruby

- Install rbenv via Homebrew: `brew install rbenv`.
- Download a version of Ruby via rbenv (e.g., `rbenv install 2.2.3`). See <https://gorails.com/setup/osx/10.11-el-capitan>.
- Make it the global version of Ruby: `rbenv global 2.2.3`.

*Installing and managing Ruby with rbenv allows us to specify versions of Ruby on a per-project basis. It also means we can avoid running sudo commands for installing gems and more as it's not affecting OS X's system Ruby.*

*Having trouble with nokogiri? See <https://stackoverflow.com/a/41491487>.*

### 6. Additional dependencies

- Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
  - See [notes](https://gist.github.com/indiesquidge/ec010eca3ffa254788c2) on using the `brewup` command added to the [.bashprofile](./.base_profile).
  - [Aricle](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/blog/2014/03/18/keeping-homebrew-date/) on keeping Homebrew up to date.
  - [Aricle on using Homebrew](https://hackercodex.com/guide/mac-development-configuration/).
- Install node via Homebrew: `brew install node`.
- Install Sass, Jekyll, and Rouge: `gem install bundler sass jekyll rouge`.

### 7. Setup ~~Atom~~ [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)


#### 7.1 Enable CLI for Sublime Text 3

Enable `subl` Terminal commands, Use command: `sudo ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" /usr/local/bin/subl;`.

_Note_ this seems to be problematic sometimes so if errornous, use symlink with `rm /usr/local/bin/subl` and the re-apply first command.
