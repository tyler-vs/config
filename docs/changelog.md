# Changelog 

Going to test change logging and using a semantic version number for this repo.

## What is a change log?

> A changelog is a log or record of all notable changes made to a project. The project is often a website or software project, and the changelog usually includes records of changes such as bug fixes, new features, etc. Some open source projects include a changelog as one of the top level files in their distribution.

> A changelog has historically included all changes made to a project. The "Keep a CHANGELOG" site instead advocates that a changelog not include all changes, but that it should instead contain "a curated, chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version of a project" and should not be a "dump" of a git log "because this helps nobody".[1]
